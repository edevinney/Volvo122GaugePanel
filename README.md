The fpd files are used with Front Panel Express's Front Design app. You can use the app to produce a panel through frontpanelexpress.com directly, or you can modify in the app and then produce a pdf to guide your own fabrication.

I had FPE make the panel but drilled the mounting screws locally, hence the two files - one for the panel, one that I printed as a template. The fit turned out well, so you could do it in one step by using only the template file, setting the right diameter for your mounting holes and having FPE produce the panel.

The files are free for use under Apache 2.0, with no liabilty assumed. Use at your own risk.
